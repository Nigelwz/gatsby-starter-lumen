# Why You're Not Achieving More in Life!

I think everyone has the problem about how to control ourselves. Sometimes we have a dream or we have a idea need to be implemented, but we will be affected easily. I think we need to think  ourselves and we need to try  thinking how to do or what the reason make you do the thing. I think if we think about the factor everyday, and we can try to visualize our dream and then imagine we have achieved our dream. It will help us can't be affeted easily. If our dream need to be come true a long time, above the advise is helpful. 
    
    
Executive ability is a keypoint, because a lot of people have "put off" habit. We always afraid of being fail. However if the fail factor is much, we will be afraid to implement our plan.   If we have some fail factors it will stop us from going forward. Although I think we need to think
more of it when we want to implement a plan, but we also need to think our solution when we are fail. So I think if we find the factor of fail and we find the solution, it will prevent us put off our plan. I think the keypoint is we can't afraid to do something if we like it.

    
Consistency is the third point. we will need to promise by ourselves, if we want to do something we can't give up easily. If we don't trust us, I think other one will not trust us easily. I think if we spend much time to do something, it will generate result. Although it is difficult, but I think if we keep do a thing, we will get feedback.
